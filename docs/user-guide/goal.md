# Goal

OpenFABR CDF defines a contractual framework to be used between these two personas to solve the above problems. Platform Engineering can encapsulate their expertise, best practices, and policies as simpler higher-level building blocks, enabling app devs to operate their app without needing deep infra knowledge. Using an imperative programming language to implement the framework is also key to lowering the learning burden.

More on App Devs and Package Authors in later sections.
